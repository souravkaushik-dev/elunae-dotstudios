          with pre-release / [BETA] builds you have access to the latest build of the app before it is released as stable-release version. Only use pre-release if you test the app, provide feedback, and help us improve its performance. Please note that pre-release versions of the app may be pretty unstable. You may experience crashes, bugs, or other issues while using the app. This is because pre-release version is still in development.
